##### *Frozen Watchers, Twisting Dark, Pierce-Eyes, Lingering Abyss*

The Watchers are ancient beings of [[The Void]], originating from before time itself, and masters of all [[Voidborn]]. Before [[The Creation of the Universe]], The Watchers were non-physical beings that existed devoid of all feeling or thought - except that somewhere in the nothingness of the void, there was something beyond physicality.
At the creation of the universe, the silence of nothingness, which for so long The Watchers lived with in peace, was destroyed by the apperance of the other [[Realms of Existence]].
