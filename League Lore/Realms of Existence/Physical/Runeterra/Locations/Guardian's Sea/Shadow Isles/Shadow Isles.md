Once the Blessed Isles, the Shadow Isles were created during [[The Creation of Runeterra]]. With the creation of the Blessed Isles came the creation of Maokai, a treant who would find the [[Waters of Life]], and from them, populate the Blessed Isles with saplings and flora. 
At this time the isles were home to much magic, and as such, spirits were drawn to the Blessed Isles.
