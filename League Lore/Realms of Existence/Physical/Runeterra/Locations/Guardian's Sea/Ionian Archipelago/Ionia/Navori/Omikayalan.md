## *Heart of the World, Greenglade*


Omikaylan is a small woods sacred to Ionians, and once home to an even more sacred tree - the ginormous God-Willow. In ancient times the God-Willow was protected by the Vastayashai'rei.

As [[The Three Sisters]] came to power, a Freljordian raider devoted to the demi-gods, Ivern the Cruel, grew hateful of the Sisters. Him and his troops would venture to Ionia in search of magical power, and pillage their way to Omikayalan. Once being surrounded, Ivern cleaved through the tree, killing it in an attempt to break the resolve of the Vastaya, who he knew would protect it with their lives.

As soon as the tree was struck down, Ivern became transfixed - he saw the decay resulting from the battle, the life that fed on it, and the beauty that came from it - as he wept, he saw his new body, made of bark and leaves - he had become the immortal god-willow. He heard the land, the fauna and flora, crying at the loss of their god-willow, and he cried for forgiveness. When he again moved, he found himself connected to the land, the creatures, the plants, even the rocks.
Eventually he would come to find a wounded stone golem, and fashioned it a new heart from a pebble to heal it. She became a lifelong friend, called Daisy. He dedicated the rest of his existence to helping mortals free themselves of their cruelty.
