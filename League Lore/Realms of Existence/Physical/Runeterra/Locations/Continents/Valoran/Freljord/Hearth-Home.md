##### The Ram's Mountain, Broken Mountain

Hearth-Home is the home of [[Ornn]], located inside a mountain in east-[[Freljord]]. Once home to a great population, the settlements of people known as the Hearthblood around Hearth-Home were destroyed during a fight between [[Ornn]] and [[Volibear]]. 
Ornn would go on to rebuild Hearth-Home, becoming reclusive afterwards.

The location of Hearth-Home is relayed in a song sung by Nunu's mother, Layka;

> Dark smoke exhales, from the mountain half  
> And wind blows through hollow dells  
> Skies clear as day, shall soon turn gray  
> And you'll know, you're nearing Ornn
> 
> Barring your path is a chasm wide  
> Howls rise from fathomless pits  
> But close stands a bridge, frozen by time  
> And across, you'll soon find Ornn
> 
> River of fire, that scorches the earth  
> Belies his kingdom of stone  
> And steel sings its tone, as a god stands alone  
> The shaping hand, we know as Ornn
> 
> Sparks leap and fly from the star-fallen ore  
> Forging his works, divine  
> Bellows erupt, with unbridled force  
> 
> No longer lost - the Mountainsmith, Ornn
