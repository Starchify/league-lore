##### "To Understand By Unmaking" *(Ancient Shuriman)*, 8000 BN - 6000 BN

Vel'Koz was made by [[The Watchers]] as one of (if not the) first voidborn during the [[War of the Three Sisters]], with the purpose of studying Runeterra and the Physical Realm in order to find its weaknesses. After observing the fight, he slippped away, and continues to serve his purpose to this day.

Vel'Koz does not possess empathy, instead existing as purely a creature of curiosity. 

He often studies Runeterra by deconstructing parts of it, leaving whole towns empty. His method of devouring knowledge from mortals is known to leave them with a distinctive dark hole in place of their left eye.
