Maokai, a magical treant, came into existence with the [[Shadow Isles]] (at the time known as the Blessed Isles). 
He wondered the Blessed Isles until eventually he sensed a magic deep below him, and, plunging his roots deep into the ground, he discovered the [[Waters of Life]], and from them he populated the Blessed Isles with flora. 

During the Westward Migration, Maokai would meet a group of scholars who settled on the coast of the Blessed Isles. At first wary, Maokai saw their respect for the land and its natural magic, and would occasionally meet with the humans he felt he could trust. For some, he would even reveal the location of the Waters of Life.
