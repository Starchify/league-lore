Born to an unknown mother, The Three Sisters are Lissandra, Avarosa, and Serylda. In the chaos of the [[Spirit Gods]] realming Runeterra, The Three Sisters conspired to conquer the mortal world. 

Serylda attempted to command the Celestial realm, only for her voice to be stolen by the first aspect of Twilight - possibly Myisha.
Avarosa faced The Void, but was deafened by its silence. 
Lissandra attempted to command the wild magic of the Physical realm - the natural magic of the Freljordian Demi-gods.

While Anivia tried to reason with The Three Sisters, Volibear - naturally tending towards anger and destruction - and his sibling, the Iron Boar, were angered by The Three Sister's fight for power, and prepared to fight them. First, Volibear asked his brother, Ornn, to craft him weapons and armour - but Ornn, disagreeing with his brother's violent intent, refused. This defiance angered Volibear, causing him to battle with Ornn, destorying the settlements around Hearth-Home and ridding himself of the armour Ornn had once made him.

Filled with rage from the battle with his brother, Volibear next turned to fighting Lissandra, clawing her eyes and blinding her.

At around this time, a raider from the Freljord and follower of the Demi-gods named Ivern the Cruel gained a growing hate for the three sisters. Him and his crew would travel to [[Ionia]], the land of the source of magic.

Lissandra, blinded, and left unable to conquer the power of the Demi-gods, learned the art of Dreamwalking, and through it saw The Void and spoke to [[The Watchers]]. The Watchers saw this as an opportunity to invade the Physical realm by manipulating Lissandra, and in secret from her sisters she came to an agreement with them - The Watchers would grant The Three Sisters near-immortality, and turn them into Iceborn - magically altered humans resistant to cold and able to manipulate both True Ice - a rare mineral so cold it can never be melted, deadly to the touch for most mortals - and Dark Ice - True Ice which has been tainted by the void, with healing and regenerative properties. In exchange for the newfound power, Lissandra would ready Runeterra to welcome The Void and The Watchers.

Years later, The Sisters approached Ornn again. Unable to build a bridge to cross the Howling Abyss they had Ornn dig, they asked for Ornn's wisdom to learn how to make a bridge that would never break. Ornn was hesitant, sensing Lissandra's magic, and thinking magic made all strong things weaker.

Ornn would come to help The Sisters upon finding out they wished for him to dig the deepest trench in the world, into which The Sisters could lure The Watchers. Ornn, who had already planned to dig another hole, agreed, and dug the hole which would come to be known as the [[Howling Abyss]].
In turn, Lissandra offered Ornn metal from a fallen star to build the bridge with - Ornn instead used it to make himself a hammer, and would keep the hammer as payment for making the bridge. The bridge would come to be known as the [[Bridge of Sorrows]].

Between this time and the [[War of the Three Sisters]], the Frostguard Citadel would be built, and would serve to watch over the [[Howling Abyss]]. It would serve as the city of the Frostguard, Lissandra's tribe, and a holy pilgrimage site shrouded in secrecy.
