Before time and space, there was only [[The Void]], within which lay nothing but [[The Watchers]], which slept in a silence of nothingness. This silence was suddenly broken when another of the [[Realms of Existence]] appeared - the [[Celestial]] realm - bringing with it the first [[Celestials]], the [[Celestial Dragons]].

One of the celestial dragons, Aurelion Sol, Born into a world of nothingness, created stars to fill the empty space, arranging some into [[Constellations]] which were sometimes even given life - and along with the stars, Aurelion Sol's inspiration and thought created small being called Meeps. 

The constant expansion of the Celestial realm into The Void caused The Watchers wake up from their slumber, gaining sentience and growing anger at the invasion of The Void.
