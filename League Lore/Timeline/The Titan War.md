In ancient [[Ionia]] - known at the time as the First Lands - mortals lived already reasonably spiritually aware. When the Titans - gigantic bipeds several times greater than mountains - came from the sky to battle the humans.
To defend themselves, the most spiritually enlightened humans took the power of the Spirit Realm, transforming into a race known as Vastayashai'rei. 

Vastayashai'rei lived simultaneously both in the Physical and Spirit realm, with incredible powers of near-immortality, shapeshifting, and manipulation of the natural world.

The Vastayashai'rei would eventually be victorious against the titans, making them presumably extinct after The Titan War. After the war, Vastayashai'rei would mix and interbreed with humans, their chimeric descendants being the [[Vastaya]].

Vastayans would then gather in separate tribes and cultures, with different tribes retaining different levels of their magical abilities - some, such as the Oovi-Kat, would even retain the ability to shapeshift.

Remains from The Titan War can still be found to this day, from gigantic weapons to statues - or, perhaps, remains - of titans.
