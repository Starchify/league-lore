On Ornn's mountain home, [[Hearth-Home]], used to be a large settlement of people who worshipped Ornn and forged weapons and tools in his name. 

After [[The Three Sisters]] had caused Volibear and Ornn to fight, destroying this civilization, and after they had been granted power by The Watchers, The Three Sisters united all the tribes across the [[Freljord]] to defeat the Demi-gods.
