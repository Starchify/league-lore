Once the sisters had united the Freljord, Serylda and Avarossa feared The Watchers would destroy Runeterra. They viewed their subservience as a fate worse than death, as they felt the watchers make the world colder and the sky darker. Serylda and Avarossa assembled their tribes of mortal iceborn to assault the Frostguard Citadel and overthrow Lissandra and The Watchers.

They would face Lissandra and her army on the [[Bridge of Sorrows]], and as they did, [[The Watchers]] invaded up from the Howling Abyss. At this time, they created [[Vel'Koz]], one of (and possible the) first voidborn prototypes. He was made to observe and learn the weaknesses of Runeterra and the Physical Realm. In the fight ensuing fight, he would watch silently. 

In a desperate attempt to stop The Watchers, Lissandra drained the yetis, her sisters, and their armies of their magic, and used the power in a ritual to seal The Watchers below in True Ice, where they would exist between the Physical Realm and the Void. The true ice however, is not powerful enough to seal away The Watchers forever, and one day they will break out.
