Forged by an unknown group using the [[World Runes]], with the creation of [[Runeterra]] would come the creation of two [[Realms of Existence]] - the [[Physical]] realm, and the [[Spirit]] realm.

The Physical realm would act as a material manifestation of Runeterra, and the source of all Elemental Magic.
The Spirit realm, a parallel pocket of existence where time and space are less present, and would act as the source of all Spiritual Magic. 

As the oldest pocket of primordial magic in the Spirit realm, the [[Glade]] was likely created at this time.

The first life to appear on Runeterra came in the Spirit realm, as primordial [[Spirit Gods]], primordial [[Demons]], and primordial [[Yordles]]. 

As other early life, like the [[Terrestrial Dragons]], sprouted in Runeterra, so too did the early islands and continents which made up its geography. After this came the first civilizations, which resided under the [[Guardian's Sea]], and soon [[Fizz]] would come to join them.

Next, and before any mortal races, would come the Freljordian demi-gods, Ornn first, and then Anivia, Volibear (Valhir), Iron Boar, and the Seal Sister. They would shape the land they called Vorrijaard, which would later be known as [[Freljord]]. Ornn, wanting a good fight, would beat trees, melt icebergs, brawl mountains, and pound valleys into the earth. In return, the land deemed him worthy, opening up and showing its core - and in turn, the primordial flame. Ornn would also try to make a home inside a mountain with a primordial flame forge inside it - but even Ornn himself couldn't bear the heat of the primordial flame, so him and the Seal Sister dug from the ocean to the mountain, where the cool waters would cool his home, and turn to steam - which in turn, would freeze in the sky and turn to snow. 

Much later, mortal creatures would appear in Runeterra - such as Trolls, Minotaurs, Yetis, and Humans. At this time, some yordles would come to live openly with mortals, such as Gnar with Yetis.

Humans settled in the First Lands (Ancient [[Ionia]]) living in harmony with the spirit realm, Ancient [[Freljord]] (Vorrijard) where they worshipped the Freljordian Demi-gods, and the [[Camavoran Continent]].

After this, the underwater civilizations would be destroyed by predators - Fizz, grieving this loss, would go into hibernation for thousands of years.
